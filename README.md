Click on a point to hear it.
Warning: scroll and motion are laggy.

I consider this project more important to the wider community (?) than the rest, so I've licensed it as the Unlicense, one of Github's labeled options, in the hopes of that aiding it to have a bigger reach.

Tools used: OpenRouter chat, Claude Sonnet 3.7 (thinking variant)
